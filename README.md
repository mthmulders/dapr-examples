# Dapr examples

This repository contains an example application.
They are used in my blog post [Jakarta EE meets Dapr](https://maarten.mulders.it/2021/09/jakarta-ee-meets-dapr/).

## Disclaimer
The code in this repo is NOT production grade and lacks any automated testing.
I intentionally kept it as simple as possible (KISS).
Its primary purpose is demonstrating several Dapr concepts and not being a full-fledged application that can be put into production as is.

You can in no way hold me liable for damage caused directly or indirectly by using this code.
